# IDM-Trial-Reset

IDM Trial Reset is a small collection of scripts/tools intended to reset the trial period of Internet Download Manager (IDM). I am not the original author of the tool — this repository mirrors the tool for preservation and study. Use at your own risk.

## What is in this repository

- Scripts and utilities related to resetting or patching IDM trial state (see files in the repo root).
- Documentation (this README).

NOTE: I have not modified the original tool logic; examine every script before running it and do not run untrusted code on machines with sensitive data.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/SayedunMuntaka/IDM-Trial-Reset.git

2. Inspect the files and read the scripts. Do not run anything you do not understand.

3. If you decide to run a script, run it with appropriate privileges (for example, as Administrator on Windows) and only after making a full system backup or restore point.

## Security & Safety

- Always scan files with up-to-date antivirus/antimalware tools.
- Review the code before executing anything locally.
- Do not run suspicious binaries or scripts from unknown sources.
